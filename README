This Python library will test FRC robot code in conjunction with
the VIRSYS physics simulator.  It will implement the same API as WPILib,
allowing one to test the same code that will run on the cRIO.

DEPENDENCIES

1.  VIRSYS (VIrtual Robot SYStem)
    Go to http://www.virsys.org/get_started.html, and get
      * VIRSYS alpha download
      * GLUT library
    You not the LabVIEW project as this Python implementation replaces it.

2.  Python
    Go to http://python.org/download/, download Python for your platform
    virsysPy has been tested on Python 3.1.2 and Python 3.2, but others
    should work as well.

RUNNING THE PROJECT

    Run both programs simultaneously:
      * robot.py     <-- from this project, virsysPy
      * virsys.exe   <-- from the VIRSYS download, DEPENDENCIES #1
    Put your robot program in robot.py.  A sample is provided.
    It is hard coded for Autonomous mode (a fix will come later).
    For now, to test Operator Control, change:
      * robot.py: add an OperatorControl method
      * fake_wpilib.py: RobotBase.IsOperatorControl to return True
      	                RobotBase.IsAutonomous      to return False

CONFIGURATION

    To run your Python program on a different computer than VIRSYS, edit
    both network.conf and VIRSYS's virsysPhysics.txt to reflect the IP
    addresses and port numbers of the respective hosts

    Edit port numbers in cRIO_ports.conf to match the port numbers on your
    actual robot.
