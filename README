This Python library will test FRC robot code in conjunction with
the VIRSYS physics simulator.  It will implement the same API as WPILib,
allowing one to test the same code that will run on the cRIO.

DEPENDENCIES

1.  VIRSYS (VIrtual Robot SYStem)
    Go to http://www.virsys.org/get_started.html, and get
      * VIRSYS alpha download
      * GLUT library
    You not the LabVIEW project as this Python implementation replaces it.

2.  Python
    Go to http://python.org/download/, download Python for your platform
    virsysPy has been tested on Python 3.1.2 and Python 3.2, but others
    should work as well.

RUNNING THE PROJECT

    Run both programs simultaneously:
      * main.py      <-- from this project, virsysPy
      * virsys.exe   <-- from the VIRSYS download, DEPENDENCIES #1
    Put your robot program in main.py.  A sample is provided.

    You may have to edit some configuration files.  If you want to run
    your Python program on a different computer than VIRSYS, edit
    both virsysPy.conf and VIRSYS's virsysPhysics.txt to reflect the IP
    addresses and port numbers of the respective hosts
